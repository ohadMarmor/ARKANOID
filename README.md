The classic arkanoid game implemented by java with the OOP method.

The game has 4 levels and counting points.

Once there is a strike, the game is over, but it's simple to change it in the code.

The default option is to do all the levels (once you finish a level , the next would start in 3 seconds), but you can choose which
levels you would like to play, by inserting their numbers as the main arguments.

The size of the paddle and the speed of it are defined in every level, so are the balls. if you want to make it either easier or harder,
it is very simple to do so.

You can notice the polymorphism and the inheritance in the code (for example, the blocks and the paddle use the same interface, but act diffrently when the
ball hits them). There is a lot of use in design patterns in the game, such as Observer, Abstract Factory and etc. ![level4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92535416/162721832-a46d17bc-76c6-4166-9b52-14e1ef5ff453.gif)
